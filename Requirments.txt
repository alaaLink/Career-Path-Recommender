Career Path Recommender
Problem: Employees lack visibility into career growth opportunities.
Objective: Build a system recommending tailored learning paths, certifications, mentors, or projects.
Deliverables:
o Input: mocked skills profile (e.g., Linkawy360) (Linkawy360 is company internal web application has profile for each employee with data: skills , education , experience, cources, etc).
o Output: personalized recommendations (Udemy courses, mentors, projects).
o Recorded demo + one-page summary.
o Bonus: Show “why recommended” (skill gap analysis).
o Project allocation (telling this employee will match in what project).
Rules & Guidelines:
• Compete individually or in teams of 2–3 members.
• Build a demo-ready prototype.
• Prioritize UI/UX clarity and usability.
• Data layer: Real DB/store preferred (mocked infra acceptable if short on time).
• Auth: Basic authentication/roles layer if relevant.
• Notifications: Use free tools like Firebase, OneSignal, email APIs.

Mandatory:
• Basic test cases.
• Code coverage reports.
• Error handling and logging.

Extra Points:
• Scalability (multi-tenant support, offline caching, scheduled digests, export/share features).
• Use LLMs from Azure MSDN subscription (e.g., Azure OpenAI) for demo purposes.

Deliverables:
• Prototype: Web, mobile, or chat-based.
• Recorded Demo: Max 5 minutes.
• One-Page Summary: Problem & solution, tools used, architecture sketch (with infra notes), test coverage, scalability/next steps.
